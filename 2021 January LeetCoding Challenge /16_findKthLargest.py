# Kth Largest Element in an Array


# Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, 
# not the kth distinct element.

# Example 1:
# Input: [3,2,1,5,6,4] and k = 2
# Output: 5

# Example 2:
# Input: [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6] and k = 4
# Output: 4

# Note:
# You may assume k is always valid, 1 â‰¤ k â‰¤ array's length.

def findKthLargest(nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
	return sorted(nums, reverse=True)[k - 1]


assert(findKthLargest([3,2,1,5,6,4], 2) == 5)
assert(findKthLargest([3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6], 4) == 4)
