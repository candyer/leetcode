# Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II


# Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, 
# leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. Return the linked list sorted as well.

 
# Example 1:
# Input: head = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5]
# Output: [1,2,5]

# Example 2:
# Input: head = [1,1,1,2,3]
# Output: [2,3]
 

# Constraints:
# The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].
# -100 <= Node.val <= 100
# The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.


# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        dummy = ListNode(float('-inf'), head)
        pre = dummy
        while head:
            if head.next and head.val == head.next.val:
                while head.next and head.val == head.next.val:
                    head = head.next
                pre.next = head.next
            else:
                pre = pre.next
            head = head.next
        return dummy.next
