# Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II


# Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that duplicates appeared at most twice and return the new length.
# Do not allocate extra space for another array; you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

# Clarification:
# Confused why the returned value is an integer, but your answer is an array?
# Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means a modification to the input array will be known to the caller.
# Internally you can think of this:
# // nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
# int len = removeDuplicates(nums);
# // any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
# // using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
# for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
#     print(nums[i]);
# }
 

# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
# Output: 5, nums = [1,1,2,2,3]
# Explanation: Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.

# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3]
# Output: 7, nums = [0,0,1,1,2,3,3]
# Explanation: Your function should return length = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being modified to 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively. It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
 

# Constraints:
# 0 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4
# -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
# nums is sorted in ascending order.
